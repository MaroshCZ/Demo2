## Branches

Branches are very useful in version control. You can use them to try to fix some issues in code. Then you push them upstream and pull request (it has to be reviewed by someone). If the reviewer thinks its okay it can be later merged to the master branche.

## Undoing in git

Git also enables you to undo stagged or commited changes.
